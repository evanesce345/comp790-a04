I made a mini demo using some common features you would use in a VR game.

1. Grabbable objects - the Meta Interaction SDK provides a nice ability to use both hands and controllers to interact with objects.
2. Teleportation - convenient way to move around in VR environments

I followed the tutorials on Meta's website to create the scene, with some help from this kind gentleman as well:
